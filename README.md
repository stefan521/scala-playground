# Scala-Exercises

## Why
I want to get better at functional programming, and I use Scala for that. These small exercises are great for that. 

This repository contains various exercises that I scraped together. While the ideas for the functions are not mine, the implementation is my own. For example, finding the palindromes in a list is what the book suggested doing as an exercise, but the code here that actually does that is my implementation.

## How to run it
I use IntelliJ as my IDE. The project is built with sbt. If you don't like IntelliJ you can probably cd into the root directory and run:

`sbt run`

`sbt test`  

Just be aware these commands can have a very verbose output. `sbt run` will just print Hello World. `sbt test` will run all automated tests for the functions I've written. 

Ran with:
sbt version 1.6.2
Java Version openjdk 11.0.15 2022-04-19 LTS

Thanks for reading this. :)
